# Tableau-Challenge
The link to my tableau notbook is [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.quinton#!/vizhome/CitibikeData2021/Story1?publish=yes). 

## Data Cleanup Process
-The citibike data contained month by month data and I chose to analyze citibike data from February 2020 to February 2021. Since the csv files were all broken down by month I had to download each file and then clean them in a jupyter notebook using pandas. My jupyter notebook is named 'citibike_cleanup.ipynb'. After cleaning the data I saved it as a combined csv file to be then loaded into Tableau.
