# Tableau-Challenge
The link to my tableau notbook is [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.quinton#!/vizhome/CitibikeData2021/Story1?publish=yes). 

## Data Cleanup Process
-The citibike data contained month by month data and I chose to analyze citibike data from February 2020 to February 2021. Since the csv files were all broken down by month I had to download each file and then clean them in a jupyter notebook using pandas. My jupyter notebook is named 'citibike_cleanup.ipynb'. After cleaning the data I saved it as a combined csv file to be then loaded into Tableau. 

## Tableau Phenomenons
*Once the data was loaded into Tableau I began to play with visualizations.* 
### Gender
-I first decided to look at the relationship between gender and ridership based on age, duration of trips, when they were riding, along with number of riders and how it correlated with gender. I found that the highest number of male and female riders are 31. Age 52 saw a huge jump in ridership as well, but the majority listed their gender as unknown. The spike in this category makes me wonder if it accurate. Another trend I saw was that female riders average ride is longer than males, but their are more male riders than female. The time of year when ridership was highest among both males and females was in October and August, which was not surprising to me - it is the time of year when the weather is beginning to cool down from summer yet is not too cold.
